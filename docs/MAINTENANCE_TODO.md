# Maintenance TODO

A list of items that may need future maintenance work:

## Vue CLI -> Vite
This project was scaffolded and is built using the Vue CLI, which is currently in maintenance mode. `Vite` is now the official build tool/bundler for Vue (and extremely popular with other frontend frameworks). Eventually we will want to eventually migrate this project to use `Vite`.

* [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## Vuex -> Pinia

`Pinia` is now the official store for Vue and comes with much better type-safety and dev tools. It would be a good idea to eventually move off of `Vuex` in favor of `Pinia`.
